# WeatherAPP_SwifUI
Weather app with MVVM using combine and SwiftUI


This is a very simple project written in 5 hours. the functionality of the app is fetching weather data from the Rest API provider https://home.openweathermap.org/. you can get an api key which you will recieve from the source and replace it inside the app and also you need to use Lotti swift package and then you are good to go.

Design pattern of the app is MVVM and it is written with SwiftUI and Combine. the network layer is dynamic so it is easily extendable. hope you enjoy it.
